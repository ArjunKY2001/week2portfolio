              <p>Babies are born to this world,usually the humans imagine about "how" did that happen,wouldnt allow as to think about "why?".When I think about it,I have it in my case.Before going to that I can say that how I got it.When I born *I didnt have any type of handicap for any of my body parts,and ofcourse to my psychological condition(*here I is a unimaginable term ,nothing in my brain was grown to recognize that).So I born like perfect human,as unique person,like billions of people in the earth.  </p>
              <p> So I realized ,I born to take a new step in the  rate of status of surroundings.Then I tried to find the typical meaning of my name.Its a sanskrit word,which means consume from the surroundings.These sayings things was not in my control,my birth ,my name etc.But later I found the similarities between my actual interest and those uncontrolls.I listed out the similarities ,simualtaneously see that Iam getting mature.</p>
